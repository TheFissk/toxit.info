                        Toxit is a data exploration platform that centers around a weighted undirected graph representation of Reddit.com community connections.

                        Graph edges are weighted by set intersection cardinality of either moderators or commentators for a dataset under investigation.  
                        Comments are passed to a natural language processing model which returns the toxicity scoring of the comment.  The number of comments above a threshold are counted and displayed in the centre of each node.
                        Our NLP model was trained on <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.nlperspectives-1.11">The Measuring Hate Speech Corpus</a> to within 0.1132 MAE over [-1, 1].
